I am proud to announce the release of my first Gatsby theme called [**Tabini**](https://gatsbytheme.adamwebster.me/tabini).

If you don't know what Gatsby is it is a static site generator that uses React and JavaScript.  I use it to run this site and blog.


## Features of the theme

- Write articles using Markdown and MDX.
- Source content from Contentful
- Create new pages using Markdown and MDX.
- Custom content areas
  - Before the featured article list
  - Before the article list
  - Before the article content
  - Before the footer
- Built in Social graph support so when you share your links it will add an image and an excerpt of the content.
- Multiple author support
- Built with user accessability in mind.
- Build in articles search.


If you would like to give it a try you can install it by using `yarn add @adamwebster/tabini` or `npm install @adamwebster/tabini`.

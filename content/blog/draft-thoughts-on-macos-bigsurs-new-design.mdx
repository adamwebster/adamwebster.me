Before I start let me point to a great article I found while looking into this topic from *Andrew Denty* <ExternalLink url="https://www.andrewdenty.com/blog/2020/07/01/a-visual-comparison-of-macos-catalina-and-big-sur.html">A visual comparison of macOS Catalina and Big Sur</ExternalLink>.

  The Icons

The icons for macOS applications are taking some cues from the iOS relatives by introducing rounded square icons.  I personally like this change as it makes the dock more uniform. 

The icons also bring depth to icon design,  not that it every really left the macOS design language and I am hopeful that sense of depth for the icon design finds its way back to iOS. I am not saying that we should bring back skeuomorphism, but I think that there is some middle ground that should be strived for.

Everything in macOS Big Sur is a little bit brighter and more colourful. For example the gray gradient application headers have mostly been replaced with a white application header which blend more with the content section of the app. The default wallpaper is also a bit of more of a departure from the last few releases of MacOS as it is a abstract representation of a mountain range rather then a actual photo.


The corner radius of ui elements, from the the dock to the application containers themselves has been increased. Visually the radius of the corners is closer to the radius of the corners of the new **Macs**. Giving everything slightly rounded corners makes things appear softer and more welcoming.

The default applications sidebars now visually take up the full height of the application and still have a blurred transparent background behind them. Visually extending the sidebars of the applications to fit the full height of the application window reduces the amount of hard corners in the application which again makes things appear softer and for some, including myself, more pleasing to look at for a long time.

### Menu bar 

The menu bar of **macOS Big Sur** is slightly taller and is more translucent, which lets it blend in more with the desktop image that you are using. The pull down menus have increased the corner radius as well and the space between each item in the menu has increased to help improve the readability of the items. I have always appreciated **Apples** focus on accessibility and readability and they changes will help improve those areas for all users.

**macOS Big Sur** also cleans up the list of icons that show up on the right hand side of the menu bar by introducting *Control Center* to **MacOS**.

Apple is allowing more Customization to some of their applications.  In *Safari* they are allowing users to set a background image for their start page, something that other browsers have allowed for awhile now which is great to see. 

*Safari* will also be adding support for the WebExtensions API, which is currently used by browsers such as *Firefox*, and closer to the way extensions are developed for *Chrome*. **Apple** is also releasing a migration tool to help bring extensions to *Safari*.

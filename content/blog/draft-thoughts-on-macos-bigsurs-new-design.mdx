Before I start let me point you some great articles I found while looking into this topic from *Andrew Denty* <ExternalLink url="https://www.andrewdenty.com/blog/2020/07/01/a-visual-comparison-of-macos-catalina-and-big-sur.html">A visual comparison of macOS Catalina and Big Sur</ExternalLink> and *Cult of Mac* <ExternalLink url="https://www.cultofmac.com/715717/fantastic-fugly-all-new-app-icons-macos-big-sur/">Fantastic to fugly: All the new app icons in macOS Big Sur</ExternalLink>.

The icons for macOS applications are taking some cues from the iOS relatives by introducing rounded square icons.  I personally like this change as it makes the dock more uniform. 

The icons also bring depth to icon design,  not that it every really left the macOS design language and I am hopeful that sense of depth for the icon design finds its way back to iOS. I am not saying that we should bring back skeuomorphism, but I think that there is some middle ground that should be strived for.

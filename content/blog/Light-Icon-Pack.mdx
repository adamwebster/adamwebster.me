As some of you may have noticed there is an option to [buy me a hot chocolate](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/adamwebster) on every blog post. 

I enjoy posting about design and development but hosting this website and creating content has its cost and I was hoping to get some support from my readers to help keep this blog ad free.

So if you are able all I ask is for you to [buy me a hot chocolate](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/adamwebster) to help support me creating new and interesting.  

In return you will receive this pack of 32 light icons (SVGs) that I have designed.

Thanks for your support.

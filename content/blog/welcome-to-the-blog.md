This is my blog. It is a spot for me to write about things that interest me including but not limited to design, front-end development, and technology.

This blog is created in Gatsby and it currently pretty basic with no search setup as of yet it is something that I am looking to add in the future.

This site is also **brand new** and as such I am sure it has its bugs that need to be worked out so if you find something you can let me know through the [contact form](/contact) or by contacting me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/adamwebster).

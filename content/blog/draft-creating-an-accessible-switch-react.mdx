import { Switch } from './DemoComponents/AccessibleSwitch';



Accessibility on the web is a very something that should be thought about from the design process to the development and testing process. 

In this tutorial I am going to show you how to create an accessible switch component that has  keyboard and screen reader support.

The technologies that will be used in this tutorial are **React, Typescript** and **Styled Components**.

<Switch aria-label="Turn on the switch" onChange={(e) => console.log(e)} />

## Creating the basic component

The first step is to import the dependencies that we will require for the component which are React, and Styled-Components to begin with.  We will also be creating a simple test component.

```tsx render true
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const Switch = () => {
    return (
        <>Test</>
    )
}
export default Switch;
```

This component can be imported into your app using  `import Switch from '../path_to_file';`.

After this is done we can create the jsx for the component and create the styled components needed to render it.

```tsx render true
import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const StyledSwitch = styled.div`
  width: 44px;
  height: 22px;
  border-radius: 25px;
  padding: 2px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  position: relative;
  background-color: #919191;
`;

const StyledSwitchToggle = styled.div`
  background-color: #fff;
  width: 18px;
  height: 18px;
  border-radius: 50px;
  position: absolute;
  transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
  left: 2px;
`;

const Switch = () => {
    return (
       <StyledSwitch>
        <StyledSwitchToggle />
      </StyledSwitch>
    )
}

export default Switch;
```

At this point the switch should be in the off position and non functional.  In the next step we will be adding a property called active that allows you to set the switch to be in the on position.

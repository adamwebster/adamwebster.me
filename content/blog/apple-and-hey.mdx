There has been a lot going on this week just before WWDC regarding **Apple** and their rules regarding in app purchases, as well as offering apps from another source other then the **App Store**. I thought I would take some time and give my thoughts on the situation.

There is an app called [Hey](https://hey.com/), which is a email app that rethinks how email works. It cost $99 a year which along with the app gets you your own @hey.com email address. This can only be purchased from their website. **Apple** initially approved the app and when the developers went to release an update they rejected the update as they did not offer a way for users to purchase the service by using an in app purchase.

First lets look at **Apple's** cut of the **App Store** purchase.  Currently for every app purchase and single time in app purchase **Apple** takes 30% of the purchase.  I do believe **Apple** taking some sort of percentage is acceptable as the developer is using **Apple's** store as way to sell the app giving them part of the profits to pay for the store front and payment processing is needed and common. If the app offers some sort of subscription then **Apple** takes 30% the first year and the 15% the following years, which also seems pretty fair for the same reasons as they are using **Apples** services to sell the product.

Next there is the case of allowing developers to allow apps to be purchased and installed from locations other then the **App Store**. This I don't fully agree with.  I understand the security concerns of **Apple** but I think that there must be a way to allow users to take the risk of allowing apps to be installed from another source, similar to how it works currently on **macOS**, by **Apple** signing the application or the user specifically approving the app to be installed.  

   <PullQuote>Allowing developers a choice of how to sell their app, either through the App Store or their own store, is something that I believe is going to happen sooner or later.</PullQuote>

Allowing developers a choice of how to sell their app, either through the **App Store** or their own store, is something that I believe is going to happen sooner or later.  It is just a question of if **Apple** chooses to do it or is forced to do it by government regulations. I for one hope **Apple** chooses to allow it.

There also seems to be some double standards in this case.  There are apps that work the same way as **Hey**, for example **Netflix**, which also only allow you to use the app if you have an paid account, which can not be purchased as a in app purchase.  The difference is, at least in the case of **Netflix**, is that **Apple** considers this a *reader application*, but lets be honest here if **Netflix** was not on the **App Store** it would not be available on **iOS** devices and that would cause some people not to purchase a **iPad** or a **iPhone**, which would hurt **Apple's** profits.

**Apple** has responded to this situation via **Phil Schiller** (Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing) who says for the **Hey** app to be approved they have some options such as offering a free or paid version on the app store with basic email reading features and sell an upgraded service that works with their app from their website. This is a reasonable and expected response with the current rules that are in place but does not mean it is the way things should be.

As an **Apple** customer I appreciate the security and design of the hardware and software but I do think that some that **Apple** needs to make some changes allow different methods of apps being purchased and installed.

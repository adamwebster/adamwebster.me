<SectionHeader> Description </SectionHeader>

Besides Hello World one of the first projects people usually create when learning a new language or framework is a to-do application.  I wanted to take this one step further buy including a dashboard and a calendar that sorts the to-do's by date.

<SectionHeader>How it Works</SectionHeader>

When a user first loads the page they are presented with the dashboard.  From the dashboard they get a nice overview of how many items are completed, overdue, due today, or due within the next week.

The list of to-dos below the calendar shows the items for the day.  They user can change what items are shown by clicking on the date in the calendar.

To edit a to-do the user would click on the to-do item they would like edit.  This will bring them to the edit to-do screen.

To create a new to-do the user would click on the new to-do button below the list of to-dos.

To mark a to-do as completed they user would click on the circle beside the name of the to-do.

To delete a tod-o the user would click on the 'x' to the right of the to-do name.

The site is completely responsive to so changing the size of the screen will cause the layout to adapt to the screen size.
